<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

This simple 404 Not Found page was built using Svelte, SvelteKit and TailwindCSS. You can visit the demo at [devchallenges-404-not-found.netlify.app](https://devchallenges-404-not-found.netlify.app/). (It works well both on desktop and mobile)

It was relatively easy and very fun to build this project because I finished it in less than one day. I learned how to add custom fonts and custom colors —provided by the Figma design file— to the `tailwind.config.cjs` file, enabling custom utility classes like `bg-gray-1` or `font-space-mono`.
